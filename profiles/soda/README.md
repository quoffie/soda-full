# Small Open DAta framework
This is the installation profile for Drupal SODA distribution.

## What is SODA?
*Small Open DAta framework* is a Drupal 7.x distribution aimed to solve the fundamental problem of the [Open Data](http://opendefinition.org/od/) which is:

> "Where is the data?"

In fact there is a lot of data available but they are not opened or are hidden etc. Sometimes data need to be created from the beginning and it is where simple people can contribute.

Using SODA you will be able to create, manage, manipulate and export open data to several open data hubs such as [CKAN](http://ckan.org), [TheDataTank](http://thedatatank.com) etc.
